# Julia Exponentiation Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to exponentiation in Julia when dealing with negative bases. The issue arises from the way Julia handles the `^` operator for non-integer exponents and negative bases, which can deviate from the typical mathematical definition.

## Problem Description
In mathematics, raising a negative number to an even integer power should always result in a positive number. However, Julia's `^` operator might produce a complex number in certain cases, which can be unexpected and lead to errors.

## Solution
The solution involves using more explicit functions or libraries that correctly handle exponentiation with negative bases. This ensures the expected behavior is achieved and avoids unintended consequences.

## How to Reproduce
1. Save the code in `bug.jl`.
2. Run the code using Julia's REPL: `julia bug.jl`
3. Observe the output and compare it to the expected mathematical result.
